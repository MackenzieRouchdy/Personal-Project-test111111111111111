    <h2 class="Who_am_I">
        Who Am I?
    </h2>

    <p class="Who_am_I_text">
        I am a student of LCCHS currently enrolled in the IB program. For my personal project I chose to  make a website that has the potential to be posted on the internet. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="Why_website">
        Why Did I Choose To Make A Website?
    </h2>

    <p class="Why_website_text">
        I have always been interested in the creation of things online whether that be games, software or websites. I figured that I should use this opportunity to get my feet wet 
        by making my own website.
    </p>

    <h2 class="why_conspiracy">
        Why Conspiracy Theories?
    </h2>

    <p class="why_conspiracy_text">
        Along with my interests in the online world I also took this opportunity to combine that with another one of my interests of conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theories allow me
         to look at the world differently. It taught me how you shouldn't just look at the information you are given, you should try and do your own research to come to your own 
         conclusion. Personally, I think that this is the best way to learn. However, you must also make sure that you are researching accurate information produced by trustworthy
          sources as the internet can be full of lies and inaccurate information.
