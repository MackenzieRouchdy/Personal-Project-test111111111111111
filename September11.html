    The Popular Opinion
</h1>

<p class="popular_opinion_text">
    The September 11 attacks (commonly referred to as 9/11) happened on September 11th, 2001. It was caused by the terrorist organization known as Al-Qaeda and was coordinated in four attacks. This is also the main cause of the war on terror started in 2001 by the USA to combat terrorism. To this day it remains the most impactful terrorist attack in world history.
    <br> <br>
    On the morning of September 11th, 2001 four planes were hijacked, destined for the Pentagon, World Trade Center and the Capitol Building. Three out of the four planes reached their destination while the one destined for the Capitol Building crashed due to the heroics of passengers aboard. Although it did not reach the building, everyone was killed in the process, with the death toll being 40. The plane destined for the Pentagon crashed into it killing 184 people. The two planes destined for the twin towers in New York City crashed into the north and south tower with them collapsing moments after, killing thousands of people.
    <br> <br>
    Overall, the total death toll of this tragedy was around 3,000 including all of the terrorists.

    Possible Theories
</h1>

<h1 class="hologram_title">
    Holograms
</h1>

<p class="hologram_text">
    A popular theory is that there were no planes at all. Instead, it was all done with holograms. Claims were made that holograms surrounded missiles to make them look like 
    commercial air planes while the missiles were the ones to actually hit the building. These claims were made because it is believed that the planes were not strong enough to
     break through the steel material that the buildings were made out of. The claims also say that if it was not holograms then it was the use of advance computer-generated imagery 
     (CGI) to replace the missiles with planes.  
</p>

<h1 class="staged_title">
    It Was Staged
</h1>

<p class="staged_text">
    An interesting theory that has been discussed since the incident was the possibility of the attack being staged by the USA because of how much oil the Middle East has control 
    over. Is it possible that the USA staged the attack just to have an excuse to wage a war on the Middle East? This
     claim was vigorously denied by the Bush administration at the time and there was no hard evidence to support it. 
</p>

<h1 class="are_they_possible">
    Are These Theories Plausible?
</h1>

<p class="are_they_possible_text">
    Both these claims are unlikely for numerous reasons. Firstly, the hologram technology needed would have to be very advanced in order to fool thousands of people staring directly
     at it. Even though it is from afar, we are still years away from this technology-wise. If the people who committed these crimes were able to have 
     access to this high tech, how would they have made the plane-sized hole in the side of the building if it was actually a missile that hit it. 
     if the building itself was a hologram, how would you account for all the people standing inside it or all of the dust and debris after the collapse? As for the CGI aspect, this
       one is even more unlikely as there were thousands of people who witness the planes pre production therefore eliminating any attempt at trying to fix it in post production.

<p class="are_they_possible2">
    Secondly, it is very improbable for it to be staged since all the deaths were not. I find it hard to believe that anyone that has any authority to stage such an attack would 
    have enough evil in them to kill all the innocent victims. But let's say that there is someone with enough power to stage this who does not have any feeling for the consequences,
     it is still unlikely as Osama Bin Laden later took responsibility for the attacks.
