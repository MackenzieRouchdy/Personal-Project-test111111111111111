    <img class="pistol_img" src="images/WaltherPPK-E.png" alt="pistol">

    <p class="popular_opinion_text">
        On the 30th of April, 1945, surrounded by Soviet troops Hitler used a Walther PPK 7.65 pistol to shoot himself in his right 
        temple. Slowly after this his wife whom he had married a couple days prior in a bunker killed herself as well with 
        cyanide poisoning. Hitler's death was announced on the 1st of May 1945 when both him and his wife's body was sprayed with 
        petrol and burned. According to sources, the soviet union released conspiracy theories explaining how Hitler was not dead and
         instead is being safeguarded by former western allies. 
    </p>

    <p class="popular_opinion_text2">
        There have been no reported eye witnesses to the actaul shooting of Hitler but only witnesses that say to have heard the bullet and 
        smelled the cyanide shortly after the alleged death.

        Possible Theories:
    </h1>

    <h1 class="hitler_wife_title">
        Hitler and his wife survived and escaped from Berlin:
    </h1>

    <p class="hitler_wife_text">
        This theory originates are from the popular history channel show called hunting Hitler. In this show, investigators discovered and
         read classified documents that elaborate on Hitler's death and how it happened. In the show they also interview alleged 
         witnesses that were involved in Hitler's escape of Germany to Argentina, where he and other Nazi's are supposedly plotting a Fourth Reich. 
         This claim explores the possibility of another reign of power for Hitler and how he continues to try and fulfill his 
         agenda. An intriguing point about this theory is Albert Panka who apparently was arrested over three hundred times. 
         This is not because he has done any crimes or reckless activity but instead it is because he was almost identical to the 
         former leader of Germany. Further more, this sighting was in South America in 1969.

    <h1 class="eva_title"> 
        Eva Braun (Hitler's wife) shot Hitler then took her own life:
    </h1>

    <p class="eva_text">
        Days before the death of Hitler, he married Evan Braun, a German photographer. The relationship was very private and no one 
        new about it until after both their alleged deaths. The two met when Braun was a 17 year old girl, she was the assistant to 
        Heinrich Hoffmann who was Hitler's personal photographer at the time. In 1936, Braun was inducted into Hitler's household
         where she became part of Hitler's inner social circle. This theory states that Braun had secretly killed her husband and 
         then took her own life to cover it up. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="plausible">
        Are These Theories Plausible?
    </h1>

    <p class="plausible_text">
        Both these theories just don't have enough evidence to be considered fact. The only reason these theories started was because 
        of the people saying that they have seen and perhaps even aided Hitler in escaping to south America. Even though TV shows and
         movies claim to have seen documents or talked to people with dangerous information, it is more then likely a money grab or
          just to make the content more interesting. These claims are hard to prove because of the lack of evidence on the witnesses 
          part therefore these theories should be considered fake until proven real.
