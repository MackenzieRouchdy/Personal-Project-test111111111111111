    The Popular Opinion
</h1>

<p class="popular_opinion_text">
    The Zodiac killer is one of the most famous unsolved murder cases that has eluded detectives and cipher crackers alike. There 
    have been five confirmed deaths surrounding the Zodiac Killer but the killer claimed to have killed thirty-seven. The Zodiac
     Killer sent several letters to different news outlets demanding they be published. The letters contained ciphers and 
     cryptograms (encrypted text) where he would explain how he was collecting victims for the afterlife to use them as slaves. This
      case has never been solved and authorities only ever mentioned one suspect that did not match the DNA of the killer therefore 
      it was a dead end.

    Possilbe Theories:
</h1>

<h1 class="fake_news_title">
    News Outlets fake the letters in a goal to sell more papers:
</h1>

<p class="fake_news_text">
    The Zodiac's victims had no known connection and were not at all related. This leads theorists to think that the entire thing 
    was a fake, pulled off by news outlets in order to sell more papers. This was close to an era where technology was becoming more
     and more advanced. Perhaps the newspaper outlets feared that their newspapers would stop being sold.

<h1 class="savant_title">
    The Zodiac Killer has savant syndrome:
</h1>

<p class="savant_text">
    Savant Syndrome is a condition where only about one in ten autistic people have. This syndrome allows for extraordinary skills 
    to come at ease such as photographic memory. If the Zodiac Killer had this syndrome it would explain his crazy letters about the
     afterlife and it would also shed light to how he was able to evade capture and write the ciphers and cryptographs. 
</p>

<h1 class="plausible">
    Are these theories plausible?
</h1>

<p class="plausible_text">
    The first theory is plausible as it involves motive. This would be the money 
    that could be made. At the time everyone knew that technology would be taking over whether they liked it or not, even though
     newspapers would still be mainstream for a while, the newspaper outlets were probably scared that their papers won't sell 
     enough so they wanted to cement themselves in the news industry by having the most interesting storylines. They saw five 
     unrelated murders come up and decided to link them all together with the letters supposedly getting mailed them in order to create an unsolvable 
     mystery. Overall, with this information it is definitely a possibility that this theory can be true but the lack of evidence is what is not 
     confirming it.
